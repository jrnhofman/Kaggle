Instructions for whoever reads this.

The notebook is the main code source, the requirements are on top. The feature preparation etc. is done in the first part, then a file called data.pkl is saved (also already in the zip.) The modeling part starts with loading this data file (cell 26), at the end the model is saved in model.pkl. I've tried different things after (that didn't work) and those are commented out in the notebook.
